# Archon Backup
Archon is an open source backup utility for Linux and Windows. It works in the command-line and uses good compression.

First of all, I want to say thanks to the developers of termcolor. I use termcolor as a module in my applicatioon to style the output. Termcolor is licensed under the MIT License. You can find the license text of it under legal/termcolor.txt. I also want to say Thank You to all the other developers of the oher python-included libraries I used.
