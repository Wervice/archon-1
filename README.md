First, I want to say thanks to the developers of termcolor. I use termcolor as a module in my application to style the output. Termcolor is licensed under the MIT License. You can find the license text of it under legal/termcolor.txt. I also want to say Thank You to all the other developers of the other python-included libraries I used.
