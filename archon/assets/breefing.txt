Archon allows you to backup files and folders to local locations, media drives,
network locations and ftp servers.
The backup archives are compressed and tar formatted.
Archon also supports full backup encryption using a strong AES Api.
Please open the Readme file on my respository for this on GitHub,
to learn more about how to use this tool.
I want to say "Thank you" to the developers of all the amazing python libraries is used.
I've added the license textes for termcolor ("MIT License") 
and pyAesCrypt ("Apache License 2.0") in the folder "legal".
